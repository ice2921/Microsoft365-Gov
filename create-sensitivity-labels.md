# Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

First, create and configure the sensitivity labels that you want to make available for apps and other services. For example, the labels you want users to see and apply from Office apps. 

Then, create one or more label policies that contain the labels and policy settings that you configure. It's the label policy that publishes the labels and settings for your chosen users and locations.

## Before you begin

The global admin for your organization has full permissions to create and manage all aspects of sensitivity labels. If you aren't signing in as a global admin, see [Permissions required to create and manage sensitivity labels](get-started-with-sensitivity-labels.md#permissions-required-to-create-and-manage-sensitivity-labels).

## Create and configure sensitivity labels

1. Navigate to Security & Compliance :
    
    - Microsoft 365 compliance Center: 
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**
        
2. On the **Labels** page, select **+ Create a label** to start the New sensitivity label wizard. 
    
    For example, from the Microsoft 365 compliance center:
    
    ![Create a sensitivity label](../media/create-sensitivity-label-full.png)
    
    Note: By default, tenants don't have any labels and you must create them. The labels in the example picture show default labels that were [migrated from Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels).

3. On the **Define the scope for this label** page, the options selected determine the label's scope for the settings that you can configure and where they will be visible when they are published:
    
    ![Scopes for sensitivity labels](../media/sensitivity-labels-scopes.png)
**NOTE**: at the time of this writing the options for **"Groups & sites" and "Azure Purview assets (preview)"** are not available for GCC-High customers
    
    - If **Files & emails** is selected, you can configure settings in this wizard that apply to apps that support sensitivity labels, such as Office Word and Outlook. If this option isn't selected, the wizard displays the first page of these settings but you can't configure them and the labels won't be available for users to select in these apps.

4. Follow the prompts in the wizard for the label settings.
    
    For more information about the label settings, see [What sensitivity labels can do](sensitivity-labels.md#what-sensitivity-labels-can-do) from the overview information and use the help in the wizard for individual settings.

5. Repeat these steps to create more labels. However, if you want to create a sublabel, first select the parent label and select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Add sub label**.

6. When you have created all the labels you need, review their order and if necessary, move them up or down. To change the order of a label, select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**. For more information, see [Label priority (order matters)](sensitivity-labels.md#label-priority-order-matters) from the overview information.

To edit an existing label, select it, and then select the **Edit label** button:

![Edit label button to edit a sensitivity label](../media/edit-sensitivity-label-full.png)

This button starts the **Edit sensitivity label** wizard, which lets you change all the label settings in step 4.

Don't delete a label unless you understand the impact for users. For more information, see the [Removing and deleting labels](#removing-and-deleting-labels) section. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you edit a label that's already published by using a label policy, no extra steps are needed when you finish the wizard. For example, you don't need to add it to a new label policy for the changes to become available to the same users. However, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to replicate to users and services.

Until you publish your labels, they won't be available to select in apps or for services. To publish the labels, they must be [added to a label policy](#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On this **Labels** tab, do not select the **Publish labels** tab (or the **Publish label** button when you edit a label) unless you need to create a new label policy. You need multiple label policies only if users need different labels or different policy settings. Aim to have as few label policies as possibleâ€”it's not uncommon to have just one label policy for the organization.

## Publish sensitivity labels by creating a label policy

1. In your labeling admin center, navigate to sensitivity labels:
    
    - Security & Compliance Center:
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**

2. Select the **Label policies** tab, and then **Publish labels** to start the Create policy wizard:
    
    For example, from the Microsoft 365 compliance center:
        
    ![Publish labels](../media/publish-sensitivity-labels-full.png)
    
    Note: By default, tenants don't have any label policies and you must create them. 

3. In the wizard, select **Choose sensitivity labels to publish**. Select the labels that you want to make available in apps and to services, and then select **Add**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you select a sublabel, make sure you also select its parent label.
    
4. Review the selected labels and to make any changes, select **Edit**. Otherwise, select **Next**.

5. Follow the prompts to configure the policy settings.
    
    The policy settings that you see match the scope of the labels that you selected. For example, if you selected labels that have just the **Files & emails** scope, you don't see the policy settings **Apply this label by default to groups and sites** and **Require users to apply a label to their groups and sites**.
    
    For more information about these settings, see [What label policies can do](sensitivity-labels.md#what-label-policies-can-do) from the overview information and use the help in the wizard for individual settings.

7. Repeat these steps if you need different policy settings for different users or scopes. For example, you want additional labels for a group of users, or a different default label for a subset of users. Or, if you have configured labels to have different scopes.

8. If you create more than one label policy that might result in a conflict for a user, review the policy order and if necessary, move them up or down. To change the order of a label policy, select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**. For more information, see [Label policy priority (order matters)](sensitivity-labels.md#label-policy-priority-order-matters) from the overview information.

Completing the wizard automatically publishes the label policy. To make changes to a published policy, simply edit it. There is no specific publish or republish action for you to select.

To edit an existing label policy, select it, and then select the **Edit Policy** button: 

![Edit a sensitivity label](../media/edit-sensitivity-label-policy-full.png)

This button starts the **Create policy** wizard, which lets you edit which labels are included and the label settings. When you complete the wizard, any changes are automatically replicated to the selected users and services.

Users see new labels in their Office apps within one hour. However, allow up to **24 hours** for changes to existing labels to replicate to all users and services.

### Additional label policy settings with Security & Compliance Center PowerShell

Additional label policy settings are available with the [Set-LabelPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-labelpolicy) cmdlet from [Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

For the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client only, you can specify [advanced settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations) that include setting a different default label for Outlook, and implement pop-up messages in Outlook that warn, justify, or block emails being sent. For the full list, see [Available advanced settings for label policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations#available-advanced-settings-for-label-policies) from this client's admin guide.

## Removing and deleting labels

In a production environment, it's unlikely that you will need to remove sensitivity labels from a label policy, or delete sensitivity labels. It's more likely that you might need to do one or either of these actions during an initial testing phase. Make sure you understand what happens when you do either of these actions.

Removing a label from a label policy is less risky than deleting it, and you can always add it back to a label policy later if needed:

- When you remove a label from a label policy so that the label is no longer published to the originally specified users, the next time the label policy is refreshed, users no longer see that label to select in their Office app. However, if the label has been applied to documents or emails, the label isn't removed from that content. Any encryption that was applied by the label remains and the underlying protection template remains published. 

- For labels that are removed but have previously been applied to content, users who are using built-in labeling for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, still see the applied label name on the status bar. Similarly, labels that are removed that were applied to SharePoint sites still display the label name in the **Sensitivity** column.

In comparison, when you delete a label:

- If the label applied encryption, the underlying protection template is archived so that previously protected content can still be opened. Because of this archived protection template, you won't be able to create a new label with the same name. Although it's possible to delete a protection template by using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/aipservice/remove-aipservicetemplate), don't do this unless you're sure you don't need to open content that was encrypted with the archived template.

- For desktop apps: The label information in the metadata remains, but because a label ID to name mapping is no longer possible, users don't see the applied label name displayed (for example, on the status bar) so users will assume the content isn't labeled. If the label applied encryption, the encryption remains and when the content is opened, uses still see the name and description of the now archived protection template.

- For Office on the web: Users don't see the label name on status bar or in the **Sensitivity** column. The label information in the metadata remains only if the label didn't apply encryption. If the label applied encryption, and you've enabled [sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.md), the label information in the metadata is removed and the encryption is removed. 

When you remove a sensitivity label from a label policy, or delete a sensitivity label, these changes can take up to one hour to replicate to all users and services.
